    ## Getting Started

    Once you have installed and run `gsm` with commands other than `--help` or `--version`, `gsm` will load sources from current `gem sources -l` you set.

    ## Commands

    ### List

    List sources within `gsm`.

    ```
    $ gsm list
    ```

    ### Use

    Use a source with `source_name`.

    ```
    $ gsm use Amethyst
    ```

    ### Add

    Use a source with `source_name` and `source_url`.

    ```--use```: Use the input source as well. Equivalent to `gsm add` and then `gsm use`.

    ```
    $ gsm add Amethyst https://rubygems.org/
    ```

    ### Del

    Delete a source with `source_name`.

    ```
    $ gsm del Amethyst
    ```

    ### Reset

    Reset all sources.

    ```
    $ gsm reset
    ```

    ### Mirror

    Mirror the source with `bundle`.

    ```
    $ gsm mirror Amethyst
    ```

    ### Help

    Show help info.

    ```
    $ gsm help
    ```
